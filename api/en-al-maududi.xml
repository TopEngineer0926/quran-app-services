	slaying your males and sparing your females. That was a tremendous trial for &#13;

	saved you and caused Pharaoh’s people to drown before your very eyes. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645528</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>58</verse_id><verse_number>51</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:51) And recall when We summoned Moses for a term of forty nights,&lt;sup foot_note=11218&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	and then you set up the calf as your god in his absence.&lt;sup foot_note=11219&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; You &#13;
	indeed committed a grave wrong. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645529</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>59</verse_id><verse_number>52</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:52) Yet We pardoned you that you might be grateful. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645530</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>60</verse_id><verse_number>53</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:53) And recall (that while you were committing this wrong) We gave Moses &#13;
	the Scripture&lt;sup foot_note=11220&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; and the Criterion that you are guided to the Right &#13;
	Way. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645531</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>61</verse_id><verse_number>54</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:54) And recall when (on returning with this favour) Moses said to his &#13;
	people: “My people! You have wronged yourselves by taking the calf for an object &#13;
	of worship, so turn in repentance to your Creator and kill yourselves.&lt;sup foot_note=11221&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	This will be best for you in your Creator’s sight.” Thereupon He accepted your &#13;
	repentance. Indeed He is Much-Relenting, Most Compassionate. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645532</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>62</verse_id><verse_number>55</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:55) And recall when you said: “O Moses, we will not believe in you until &#13;
	we clearly see Allah (speaking to you).” Thereupon a tremendous thunderbolt &#13;
	struck you before your very eyes. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645533</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>63</verse_id><verse_number>56</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:56) Then We revived you after your extinction, that you might be grateful.&lt;sup foot_note=11222&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645534</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>64</verse_id><verse_number>57</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:57) And We caused a cloud to comfort you with shade,&lt;sup foot_note=11223&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and &#13;
	We sent down upon you manna and the quails,&lt;sup foot_note=11224&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (saying): “Eat of &#13;
	the good wherewithal that We have provided you as sustenance.” And by their &#13;
	sinning (your forefathers) did not wrong Us: it is they themselves whom they &#13;
	wronged. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645535</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>65</verse_id><verse_number>58</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:58) And recall when We said: “Go into this town&lt;sup foot_note=11225&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and eat &#13;
	abundantly of its food; but enter the gate prostrate, saying, “Repentance”.&lt;sup foot_note=11226&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;We &#13;
	will forgive you your sins and shall bestow more favour on the doers of good.”&#13;

	been given them; and so We sent down a scourge upon the wrong-doers from the &#13;
	heavens for their transgression. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645537</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>67</verse_id><verse_number>60</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:60) And recall when Moses prayed for water for his people and We replied: &#13;
	“Strike the rock with your staff.” And there gushed out from it twelve springs&lt;sup foot_note=11227&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	and each tribe knew its drinking-place. (Then you were directed): “Eat and drink &#13;
	of the sustenance provided by Allah, and do not go about acting wickedly on &#13;
	earth, spreading mischief.” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645538</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>68</verse_id><verse_number>61</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:61) And recall when you said: “O Moses, surely we cannot put up with one &#13;
	sort of food, so pray to your Lord to bring out for us what the earth produces &#13;
	– its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its garlic and &#13;
	its onions.” Then Moses said: “Will you take a meaner thing in exchange for &#13;
	what is better?&lt;sup foot_note=11228&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Go down to some city and there you shall get &#13;
	what you ask for.” And ignominy and wretchedness were pitched upon them and &#13;
	they were laden with the burden of Allah’s wrath. This was because they denied &#13;
	the Signs of Allah&lt;sup foot_note=11229&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and slew the Prophets unrightfully.&lt;sup foot_note=11230&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	All this, because they disobeyed and persistently exceeded the limits (of the &#13;
	Law). &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645539</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>69</verse_id><verse_number>62</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:62) Whether they are the ones who believe (in the Arabian Prophet), or &#13;
	whether they are Jews, Christians or Sabians – all who believe in Allah and &#13;
	the Last Day, and do righteous deeds – their reward is surely secure with their &#13;
	Lord; they need have no fear, nor shall they grieve.&lt;sup foot_note=11231&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645540</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>70</verse_id><verse_number>63</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:63) And recall when We made a covenant with you and caused the Mount Sinai &#13;
	to tower above you,&lt;sup foot_note=11232&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (saying): “Hold fast to the Book that We &#13;
	have given you, and remember the directives and commandments in it, that you &#13;
	be pious.” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645541</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>71</verse_id><verse_number>64</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:64) Then you turned away from your covenant, and had it not been for Allah’s &#13;
	grace and mercy upon you, you would have long been utter losers. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645542</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>72</verse_id><verse_number>65</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:65) And you know the case of those of you who broke the Sabbath,&lt;sup foot_note=11233&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	how We said to them: “Become apes, despised and hated.”&lt;sup foot_note=11234&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645543</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>73</verse_id><verse_number>66</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:66) And thus We made their end a warning for the people of their own time &#13;
	and for the succeeding generations, and an admonition to the God-fearing.&#13;
	&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645544</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>74</verse_id><verse_number>67</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:67) And then recall when Moses said to his people: “Behold, Allah commands &#13;
	you to slaughter a cow.” They said: “Are you jesting with us?” Moses answered: &#13;
	“I seek refuge in Allah that I should behave in the manner of the ignorant.”&#13;
	&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645545</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>75</verse_id><verse_number>68</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:68) They said: “Pray to your Lord that He make clear to us what she is &#13;
	like.” Moses answered: “He says, she is a cow, neither old nor immature, but &#13;
	of an age in between the two. Do, then, what you have been commanded.” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645546</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>76</verse_id><verse_number>69</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:69) They said: “Pray to your Lord that He make clear to us of what colour &#13;
	she is.” Moses answered: “He says, she is a yellow cow, with a bright colour &#13;
	which is pleasing to those who see!” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645547</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>77</verse_id><verse_number>70</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:70) They said: “Pray to your Lord that He make clear to us what cow she &#13;
	is. Cows seem much alike to us, and if Allah wills, we shall be guided.”&lt;sup foot_note=11235&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645548</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>78</verse_id><verse_number>71</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:71) Moses answered: “Lo! He says, she is a cow unyoked to plough the earth &#13;
	or to water the tillage, one that has been kept secure, with no blemish on her!” &#13;
	Thereupon they cried out: “Now you have come forth with the information that &#13;
	will direct us aright.” And they slaughtered her although they scarcely seemed &#13;
	to do so. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645549</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>79</verse_id><verse_number>72</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:72) And recall when you killed a man and then began to remonstrate and &#13;
	cast the blame (of killing) upon one another even though Allah was determined &#13;
	to bring to light what you were hiding. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645550</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>80</verse_id><verse_number>73</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:73) Then We ordered: “Smite the corpse with a part of it.” Thus does Allah &#13;
	bring the dead to life and thus does He show His Signs that you might understand.&lt;sup foot_note=11236&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645551</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>81</verse_id><verse_number>74</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:74) Then (even after observing this) your hearts hardened and became like &#13;
	stones, or even harder. For surely there are some stones from which streams &#13;
	burst forth and some that split asunder and water issues out, and some that &#13;
	crash down for fear of Allah. Allah is not heedless of the things you do.&#13;
	&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645552</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>82</verse_id><verse_number>75</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:75) Do you hope that these people will believe in the Message you are &#13;
	preaching,&lt;sup foot_note=11237&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; even though a party of them has been wont to listen &#13;
	to the Word of Allah and after they had fully grasped it, knowingly distorted &#13;
	it?&lt;sup foot_note=11238&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645553</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>83</verse_id><verse_number>76</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:76) And when they meet those who believe (in Muhammad) they say: “We too &#13;
	believe in him.” But in their intimate meetings they say to one another: “How &#13;
	foolish! Why should you intimate to them what Allah has revealed to you, for &#13;
	they will use it as argument against you before your Lord?”&lt;sup foot_note=11239&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645554</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>84</verse_id><verse_number>77</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:77) Are they unaware that Allah knows all that they hide and all that &#13;
	they disclose? &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645555</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>85</verse_id><verse_number>78</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:78) Among them are also the unlettered folk who do not know about the &#13;
	Scriptures but cherish baseless wishes and merely follow their conjectures.&lt;sup foot_note=11240&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645556</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>86</verse_id><verse_number>79</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:79) Woe, then, to those who write out the Scriptures with their own hands &#13;
	and then, in order to make a trifling gain, claim: “This is from Allah.”&lt;sup foot_note=11241&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they &#13;
	thus earn. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645557</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>87</verse_id><verse_number>80</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:80) They say: “The Fire will certainly not touch us except for a limited &#13;
	number of days.”&lt;sup foot_note=11242&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Say (to them): “Have you received a promise &#13;
	from Allah – for Allah never breaks His promise – or do you attribute to Allah &#13;
	something about which you have no knowledge?” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645558</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>88</verse_id><verse_number>81</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:81) Those who earn evil and are encompassed by their sinfulness are the &#13;
	people of the Fire, and there will they abide; &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645559</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>89</verse_id><verse_number>82</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:82) those who believe and do righteous deeds are the people of the Garden, &#13;
	and there will they abide. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645560</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>90</verse_id><verse_number>83</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:83) And recall when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: “You &#13;
	shall serve none but Allah and do good to parents, kinsmen, orphans and the &#13;
	needy; you shall speak kindly to people, and establish Prayer and give Zakah &#13;
	(Purifying Alms). And yet, except for a few of you, you turned back on this &#13;
	covenant, and you are still backsliders. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645561</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>91</verse_id><verse_number>84</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:84) And recall when We made a covenant with you, that you shall not shed &#13;
	one another’s blood, and shall not turn out one another from your homelands; &#13;
	you confirmed it, and you yourselves are witnesses to it. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645562</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>92</verse_id><verse_number>85</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:85) And here you are, killing one another, turning out a party of your &#13;
	own from their homelands, aiding one another against them in sin and enmity, &#13;
	and if they come to you as captives you ransom them although the very act of &#13;
	expelling them was unlawful to you. Do you believe in a part of the Scripture &#13;
	and reject the rest?&lt;sup foot_note=11243&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; What else, then, could be the retribution &#13;
	of those among you who do this than that they should live in degradation in &#13;
	the present life, and that on the Day of Resurrection they should be sent to &#13;
	the severest chastisement? Allah is not heedless of what you do. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645563</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>93</verse_id><verse_number>86</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:86) These are the ones who have bought the present life in exchange for &#13;
	the World to Come. Their chastisement shall not be lightened, nor shall they &#13;
	be helped. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645564</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>94</verse_id><verse_number>87</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:87) Surely We gave Moses the Scripture and caused a train of Messengers &#13;
	to follow him and then sent Jesus, the son of Mary, with Clear Proofs and supported &#13;
	him with the spirit of holiness.&lt;sup foot_note=11244&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; But is it not true that every &#13;
	time a Messenger brought to you something that was not to your liking, you acted &#13;
	arrogantly: you called some Messengers liars and killed others? &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645565</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>95</verse_id><verse_number>88</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:88) They say: “Our hearts are well-protected.”&lt;sup foot_note=11245&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; No! The &#13;
	fact is that Allah has cursed them because of their denying the Truth. So, scarcely &#13;
	do they believe. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645566</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>96</verse_id><verse_number>89</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:89) And now that there has come to them a Book from Allah, how are they &#13;
	treating it? Even though it confirms the Truth already in their possession, &#13;
	and even though they had prayed for victory against the unbelievers, and yet &#13;
	when that Book came to them – and they recognized it – they refused to acknowledge &#13;
	its Truth.&lt;sup foot_note=11246&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Allah’s curse be upon the unbelievers. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645567</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>97</verse_id><verse_number>90</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:90) Evil indeed is what they console themselves with.&lt;sup foot_note=11247&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; They &#13;
	deny the guidance revealed by Allah, grudging that He chose to bestow His gracious &#13;
	bounty (of revelation and prophethood) on some of His servants whom He willed.&lt;sup foot_note=11248&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	Thus they have brought on themselves wrath after wrath, and a humiliating chastisement &#13;
	is in store for such unbelievers. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645568</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>98</verse_id><verse_number>91</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:91) When they are told: “Believe in what Allah has revealed,” they say: &#13;
	“We believe only in what was revealed to us (Israel).” They deny everything &#13;
	else even though it be the Truth which confirms what they possess. Say (to them): &#13;
	“If indeed you are believers, why is it that in the past you killed the Prophets &#13;
	of Allah (who were from Israel)?” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645569</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>99</verse_id><verse_number>92</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:92) Moses came to you with clear proofs and yet you were so wont to wrong-doing &#13;
	that as soon as he was gone you took to worshipping the calf. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645570</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>100</verse_id><verse_number>93</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:93) Recall the covenant We made with you and caused the Mount to tower &#13;
	above you, stressing: “Hold to what We have given you with full strength and &#13;
	give heed to it.” But their forefathers said: “We hear, but we disobey” – for &#13;
	their hearts were overflowing with love for the calf because of their unbelief. &#13;
	Say: “If you are people of faith, then evil are the things that your faith enjoins &#13;
	upon you.” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645571</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>101</verse_id><verse_number>94</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:94) Say to them: “If indeed the Last Abode with Allah is yours, in exclusion &#13;
	of other people, then long for death&lt;sup foot_note=11249&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; if you are truthful.”&#13;

	indeed even more eager than those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity. &#13;
	Each one of them wishes to live a thousand years although the bestowal of long &#13;

	this their father exclaimed: &quot;Nay (this is not true); rather your evil souls &#13;
	have made it easy for you to commit a heinous act. So I will bear this patiently, &#13;
	and in good grace.&lt;sup foot_note=12707&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; It is Allah's help alone that I seek against &#13;

	As he let down his bucket in the well he (observed Joseph) and cried out: &quot;This &#13;
	is good news. There is a boy.&quot; They concealed him, considering him as part of &#13;

	&quot;Take good care of him, possibly he might be of benefit to us or we might adopt &#13;
	him as a son.&quot;&lt;sup foot_note=12712&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Thus We found a way for Joseph to become established &#13;
	in that land and in order that We might teach him to comprehend the deeper meaning &#13;
	of things.&lt;sup foot_note=12713&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Allah has full power to implement His design although &#13;

	sought to tempt him to herself, and one day bolting the doors she said: &quot;Come &#13;
	on now!&quot; Joseph answered: &quot;May Allah grant me refuge! My Lord has provided an &#13;
	honourable abode for me (so how can I do something so evil)? Such wrong-doers &#13;
	never prosper.&quot;&lt;sup foot_note=12715&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647090</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1620</verse_id><verse_number>24</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:24) And she advanced towards him, and had Joseph not perceived a sign&lt;sup foot_note=12716&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	from his Lord he too would have advanced towards her. Thus was Joseph shown &#13;
	a sign from his Lord that We might avert from him all evil and indecency,&lt;sup foot_note=12717&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;

	the other, and she tore Joseph's shirt from behind. Then both of them found &#13;
	the husband of the lady at the door. Seeing him she said: &quot;What should be the &#13;

	a witness belonging to her own household testified&lt;sup foot_note=12718&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (on grounds &#13;
	of circumstantial evidence): &quot;If his shirt is torn from the front, then she &#13;

	&quot;Surely, this is one of the tricks of you women; your tricks are indeed great.&#13;

	signalled Joseph: &quot;Come out to them.&quot; When the ladies saw him they were so struck &#13;
	with admiration that they cut their hands, exclaiming: &quot;Allah preserve us. This &#13;

	though they had seen clear signs&lt;sup foot_note=12724&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (of Joseph's innocence and of &#13;

	One of them said: &quot;I saw myself pressing wine in a dream&quot;; and the other said: &#13;
	&quot;I saw myself carrying bread on my head of which the birds were eating.&quot; Both &#13;
	said: &quot;Tell us what is its interpretation; for we consider you to be one of &#13;
	those who do good.&quot;&lt;sup foot_note=12727&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647103</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1633</verse_id><verse_number>37</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:37) Joseph said: &quot;I will inform you about the interpretation of the dreams &#13;
	before the arrival of the food that is sent to you. This knowledge is part of &#13;
	what I have been taught by my Lord. I have renounced the way of those who do &#13;

	and Jacob. It is not for us to associate any with Allah in His Divinity. It &#13;
	is out of Allah's grace upon us and upon mankind (that He did not require of &#13;
	us to serve any other than Allah), and yet most people do not give thanks.&#13;

	your fathers have fabricated, without Allah sending down any sanction for them. &#13;
	All authority to govern rests only with Allah. He has commanded that you serve &#13;
	none but Him. This is the Right Way of life, though most people are altogether &#13;

	of you will serve wine to his lord (the king of Egypt).As for the other, he &#13;
	will be crucified and birds will eat of his head. The question concerning what &#13;
	you asked has thus been decided.&quot;&lt;sup foot_note=12728&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647108</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1638</verse_id><verse_number>42</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:42) And Joseph said to the one of the two prisoners who he knew would &#13;
	be set free: &quot;Mention me in your lord's presence.&quot; But Satan caused him to forget &#13;
	mentioning this to his lord (the ruler of Egypt) and so Joseph languished in &#13;

	after the lapse of a long period, what Joseph had said. He said: &quot;I will tell &#13;

	tell the true meaning of the dream in which seven fat cows are devoured by seven &#13;

	came to Joseph he said:&lt;sup foot_note=12736&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;Go back to your master and ask him about &#13;

	you sought to tempt Joseph?&quot; They said: &quot;Allah forbid! We found no evil in him.&quot; &#13;
	The chief's wife said: &quot;Now the truth has come to light. It was I who sought &#13;
	to tempt him.

	may know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that Allah does not allow &#13;

	my own service.&quot; So when Joseph spoke to him the king said: &quot;You are now one &#13;

	am a good keeper and know my task well.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647122</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1652</verse_id><verse_number>56</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:56) Thus did We establish Joseph in the land so that he could settle &#13;
	wherever he pleased.&lt;sup foot_note=12742&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; We bestow favour, out of Our Mercy, on whomsoever &#13;

	&quot;Bring to me your other brother from your father. Do you not see that I give &#13;

	him. Be sure we shall do so.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647128</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1658</verse_id><verse_number>62</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:62) And Joseph said to his servants: &quot;Put surreptitiously in their packs &#13;
	the goods they had given in exchange for corn.&quot; Joseph did so expecting that &#13;
	they would find it when they returned home. Feeling grateful for this generosity, &#13;
	they might be inclined to return to him. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647129</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1659</verse_id><verse_number>63</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:63) When they returned to their father they said: &quot;Father! We have been &#13;
	denied further supply of corn. So send with us our brother that we may bring &#13;
	the supplies.

	you earlier with regard to his brother? Allah is the Best Protector and is the &#13;
	Most Merciful.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647131</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1661</verse_id><verse_number>65</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:65) And when they opened their things they found that their goods had &#13;
	been given back to them. Thereupon they cried: &quot;Father! What else would we desire? &#13;
	Look, even our goods have been given back to us, so we shall go now and bring &#13;
	supplies for our family, we shall protect our brother, and bring another camel-load &#13;
	of corn. That additional supply will be easily secured.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647132</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1662</verse_id><verse_number>66</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:66) Their father said: &quot;I shall never send him with you until you give &#13;
	me a solemn promise in the name of Allah that you will bring him back to me, &#13;
	unless you yourselves are surrounded.&quot; Then after they had given him their solemn &#13;
	promise, he said. &quot;Allah watches over what we have said.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647133</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1663</verse_id><verse_number>67</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:67) And he enjoined them: &quot;My sons! Do not enter the city by one gate; &#13;
	rather enter it by different gates. I can be of no help to you against Allah. &#13;
	Allah's command alone prevails. In Him have I put my trust and in Him should &#13;

	as their father had directed them, this precautionary measure proved ineffective &#13;
	against Allah's will. There was an uneasiness in Jacob's soul which he so tried &#13;
	to remove. Surely he was possessed of knowledge owing to the knowledge that &#13;
	We bestowed upon him. But most people do not know the truth of the matter.&lt;sup foot_note=12748&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647135</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1665</verse_id><verse_number>69</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:69) When they presented themselves before Joseph, he took his brother &#13;

	drinking-cup in his brother's saddlebag.&lt;sup foot_note=12750&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; And then a herald cried: &#13;
	&quot;Travellers, you are thieves.&quot;&lt;sup foot_note=12751&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647137</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1667</verse_id><verse_number>71</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:71) Turning back they asked: &quot;What have you lost?&quot; &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647138</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1668</verse_id><verse_number>72</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:72) The officials said: &quot;We have lost the king's cup.&quot; (And their chief &#13;

	shall be its recompense.&quot; Thus do we punish the wrong-doers.&lt;sup foot_note=12752&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647142</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1672</verse_id><verse_number>76</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:76) Then Joseph began searching their bags before searching his own brother's &#13;
	bag. Then he brought forth the drinking-cup from his brother's bag. Thus did &#13;
	We contrive to support Joseph.&lt;sup foot_note=12753&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; He had no right, according to the &#13;
	religion of the king (i.e. the law of Egypt), to take his brother, unless Allah &#13;
	so willed.&lt;sup foot_note=12754&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; We exalt whomsoever We will over others by several degrees. &#13;
	And above all those who know is the One Who truly knows. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647143</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1673</verse_id><verse_number>77</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:77) They said: &quot;No wonder that he steals for a brother of his stole before.&quot;&lt;sup foot_note=12755&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	But Joseph kept his reaction to himself without disclosing the truth to them. &#13;
	He merely said to himself: &quot;You are an evil lot. Allah knows well the truth &#13;
	of the accusation that you are making against me (to my face).&quot; &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>647144</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>12</chapter_id><verse_id>1674</verse_id><verse_number>78</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(12:78) They said: &quot;O powerful chief (al-aziz)!&lt;sup foot_note=12756&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; His father is &#13;
	an age-stricken man, (and in order that he may not suffer) seize one of us in &#13;

	counselled together. The eldest of them said: &quot;Do you not know that your father &#13;
	has taken a solemn promise from you in the name of Allah, and you failed in &#13;
	your duty towards Joseph? So I will not depart from this land until my father &#13;

	been guilty of stealing. We did not see him stealing but testify according to &#13;
	what we know, and obviously we had no power to keep watch over that what is &#13;
