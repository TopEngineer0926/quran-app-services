	slaying your males and sparing your females. That was a tremendous trial for &#13;

	saved you and caused Pharaoh’s people to drown before your very eyes. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645528</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>58</verse_id><verse_number>51</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:51) And recall when We summoned Moses for a term of forty nights,&lt;sup foot_note=11218&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	and then you set up the calf as your god in his absence.&lt;sup foot_note=11219&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; You &#13;
	indeed committed a grave wrong. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645529</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>59</verse_id><verse_number>52</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:52) Yet We pardoned you that you might be grateful. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645530</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>60</verse_id><verse_number>53</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:53) And recall (that while you were committing this wrong) We gave Moses &#13;
	the Scripture&lt;sup foot_note=11220&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; and the Criterion that you are guided to the Right &#13;
	Way. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645531</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>61</verse_id><verse_number>54</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:54) And recall when (on returning with this favour) Moses said to his &#13;
	people: “My people! You have wronged yourselves by taking the calf for an object &#13;
	of worship, so turn in repentance to your Creator and kill yourselves.&lt;sup foot_note=11221&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	This will be best for you in your Creator’s sight.” Thereupon He accepted your &#13;
	repentance. Indeed He is Much-Relenting, Most Compassionate. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645532</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>62</verse_id><verse_number>55</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:55) And recall when you said: “O Moses, we will not believe in you until &#13;
	we clearly see Allah (speaking to you).” Thereupon a tremendous thunderbolt &#13;
	struck you before your very eyes. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645533</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>63</verse_id><verse_number>56</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:56) Then We revived you after your extinction, that you might be grateful.&lt;sup foot_note=11222&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645534</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>64</verse_id><verse_number>57</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:57) And We caused a cloud to comfort you with shade,&lt;sup foot_note=11223&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and &#13;
	We sent down upon you manna and the quails,&lt;sup foot_note=11224&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (saying): “Eat of &#13;
	the good wherewithal that We have provided you as sustenance.” And by their &#13;
	sinning (your forefathers) did not wrong Us: it is they themselves whom they &#13;
	wronged. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645535</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>65</verse_id><verse_number>58</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:58) And recall when We said: “Go into this town&lt;sup foot_note=11225&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and eat &#13;
	abundantly of its food; but enter the gate prostrate, saying, “Repentance”.&lt;sup foot_note=11226&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;We &#13;
	will forgive you your sins and shall bestow more favour on the doers of good.”&#13;

	been given them; and so We sent down a scourge upon the wrong-doers from the &#13;
	heavens for their transgression. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645537</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>67</verse_id><verse_number>60</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:60) And recall when Moses prayed for water for his people and We replied: &#13;
	“Strike the rock with your staff.” And there gushed out from it twelve springs&lt;sup foot_note=11227&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	and each tribe knew its drinking-place. (Then you were directed): “Eat and drink &#13;
	of the sustenance provided by Allah, and do not go about acting wickedly on &#13;
	earth, spreading mischief.” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645538</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>68</verse_id><verse_number>61</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:61) And recall when you said: “O Moses, surely we cannot put up with one &#13;
	sort of food, so pray to your Lord to bring out for us what the earth produces &#13;
	– its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its garlic and &#13;
	its onions.” Then Moses said: “Will you take a meaner thing in exchange for &#13;
	what is better?&lt;sup foot_note=11228&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Go down to some city and there you shall get &#13;
	what you ask for.” And ignominy and wretchedness were pitched upon them and &#13;
	they were laden with the burden of Allah’s wrath. This was because they denied &#13;
	the Signs of Allah&lt;sup foot_note=11229&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and slew the Prophets unrightfully.&lt;sup foot_note=11230&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	All this, because they disobeyed and persistently exceeded the limits (of the &#13;
	Law). &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645539</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>69</verse_id><verse_number>62</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:62) Whether they are the ones who believe (in the Arabian Prophet), or &#13;
	whether they are Jews, Christians or Sabians – all who believe in Allah and &#13;
	the Last Day, and do righteous deeds – their reward is surely secure with their &#13;
	Lord; they need have no fear, nor shall they grieve.&lt;sup foot_note=11231&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645540</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>70</verse_id><verse_number>63</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:63) And recall when We made a covenant with you and caused the Mount Sinai &#13;
	to tower above you,&lt;sup foot_note=11232&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (saying): “Hold fast to the Book that We &#13;
	have given you, and remember the directives and commandments in it, that you &#13;
	be pious.” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645541</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>71</verse_id><verse_number>64</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:64) Then you turned away from your covenant, and had it not been for Allah’s &#13;
	grace and mercy upon you, you would have long been utter losers. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645542</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>72</verse_id><verse_number>65</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:65) And you know the case of those of you who broke the Sabbath,&lt;sup foot_note=11233&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	how We said to them: “Become apes, despised and hated.”&lt;sup foot_note=11234&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645543</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>73</verse_id><verse_number>66</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:66) And thus We made their end a warning for the people of their own time &#13;
	and for the succeeding generations, and an admonition to the God-fearing.&#13;
	&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645544</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>74</verse_id><verse_number>67</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:67) And then recall when Moses said to his people: “Behold, Allah commands &#13;
	you to slaughter a cow.” They said: “Are you jesting with us?” Moses answered: &#13;
	“I seek refuge in Allah that I should behave in the manner of the ignorant.”&#13;
	&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645545</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>75</verse_id><verse_number>68</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:68) They said: “Pray to your Lord that He make clear to us what she is &#13;
	like.” Moses answered: “He says, she is a cow, neither old nor immature, but &#13;
	of an age in between the two. Do, then, what you have been commanded.” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645546</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>76</verse_id><verse_number>69</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:69) They said: “Pray to your Lord that He make clear to us of what colour &#13;
	she is.” Moses answered: “He says, she is a yellow cow, with a bright colour &#13;
	which is pleasing to those who see!” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645547</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>77</verse_id><verse_number>70</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:70) They said: “Pray to your Lord that He make clear to us what cow she &#13;
	is. Cows seem much alike to us, and if Allah wills, we shall be guided.”&lt;sup foot_note=11235&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645548</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>78</verse_id><verse_number>71</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:71) Moses answered: “Lo! He says, she is a cow unyoked to plough the earth &#13;
	or to water the tillage, one that has been kept secure, with no blemish on her!” &#13;
	Thereupon they cried out: “Now you have come forth with the information that &#13;
	will direct us aright.” And they slaughtered her although they scarcely seemed &#13;
	to do so. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645549</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>79</verse_id><verse_number>72</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:72) And recall when you killed a man and then began to remonstrate and &#13;
	cast the blame (of killing) upon one another even though Allah was determined &#13;
	to bring to light what you were hiding. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645550</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>80</verse_id><verse_number>73</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:73) Then We ordered: “Smite the corpse with a part of it.” Thus does Allah &#13;
	bring the dead to life and thus does He show His Signs that you might understand.&lt;sup foot_note=11236&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645551</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>81</verse_id><verse_number>74</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:74) Then (even after observing this) your hearts hardened and became like &#13;
	stones, or even harder. For surely there are some stones from which streams &#13;
	burst forth and some that split asunder and water issues out, and some that &#13;
	crash down for fear of Allah. Allah is not heedless of the things you do.&#13;
	&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645552</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>82</verse_id><verse_number>75</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:75) Do you hope that these people will believe in the Message you are &#13;
	preaching,&lt;sup foot_note=11237&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; even though a party of them has been wont to listen &#13;
	to the Word of Allah and after they had fully grasped it, knowingly distorted &#13;
	it?&lt;sup foot_note=11238&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645553</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>83</verse_id><verse_number>76</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:76) And when they meet those who believe (in Muhammad) they say: “We too &#13;
	believe in him.” But in their intimate meetings they say to one another: “How &#13;
	foolish! Why should you intimate to them what Allah has revealed to you, for &#13;
	they will use it as argument against you before your Lord?”&lt;sup foot_note=11239&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645554</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>84</verse_id><verse_number>77</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:77) Are they unaware that Allah knows all that they hide and all that &#13;
	they disclose? &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645555</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>85</verse_id><verse_number>78</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:78) Among them are also the unlettered folk who do not know about the &#13;
	Scriptures but cherish baseless wishes and merely follow their conjectures.&lt;sup foot_note=11240&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645556</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>86</verse_id><verse_number>79</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:79) Woe, then, to those who write out the Scriptures with their own hands &#13;
	and then, in order to make a trifling gain, claim: “This is from Allah.”&lt;sup foot_note=11241&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they &#13;
	thus earn. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645557</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>87</verse_id><verse_number>80</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:80) They say: “The Fire will certainly not touch us except for a limited &#13;
	number of days.”&lt;sup foot_note=11242&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Say (to them): “Have you received a promise &#13;
	from Allah – for Allah never breaks His promise – or do you attribute to Allah &#13;
	something about which you have no knowledge?” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645558</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>88</verse_id><verse_number>81</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:81) Those who earn evil and are encompassed by their sinfulness are the &#13;
	people of the Fire, and there will they abide; &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645559</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>89</verse_id><verse_number>82</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:82) those who believe and do righteous deeds are the people of the Garden, &#13;
	and there will they abide. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645560</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>90</verse_id><verse_number>83</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:83) And recall when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: “You &#13;
	shall serve none but Allah and do good to parents, kinsmen, orphans and the &#13;
	needy; you shall speak kindly to people, and establish Prayer and give Zakah &#13;
	(Purifying Alms). And yet, except for a few of you, you turned back on this &#13;
	covenant, and you are still backsliders. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645561</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>91</verse_id><verse_number>84</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:84) And recall when We made a covenant with you, that you shall not shed &#13;
	one another’s blood, and shall not turn out one another from your homelands; &#13;
	you confirmed it, and you yourselves are witnesses to it. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645562</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>92</verse_id><verse_number>85</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:85) And here you are, killing one another, turning out a party of your &#13;
	own from their homelands, aiding one another against them in sin and enmity, &#13;
	and if they come to you as captives you ransom them although the very act of &#13;
	expelling them was unlawful to you. Do you believe in a part of the Scripture &#13;
	and reject the rest?&lt;sup foot_note=11243&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; What else, then, could be the retribution &#13;
	of those among you who do this than that they should live in degradation in &#13;
	the present life, and that on the Day of Resurrection they should be sent to &#13;
	the severest chastisement? Allah is not heedless of what you do. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645563</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>93</verse_id><verse_number>86</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:86) These are the ones who have bought the present life in exchange for &#13;
	the World to Come. Their chastisement shall not be lightened, nor shall they &#13;
	be helped. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645564</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>94</verse_id><verse_number>87</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:87) Surely We gave Moses the Scripture and caused a train of Messengers &#13;
	to follow him and then sent Jesus, the son of Mary, with Clear Proofs and supported &#13;
	him with the spirit of holiness.&lt;sup foot_note=11244&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; But is it not true that every &#13;
	time a Messenger brought to you something that was not to your liking, you acted &#13;
	arrogantly: you called some Messengers liars and killed others? &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645565</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>95</verse_id><verse_number>88</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:88) They say: “Our hearts are well-protected.”&lt;sup foot_note=11245&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; No! The &#13;
	fact is that Allah has cursed them because of their denying the Truth. So, scarcely &#13;
	do they believe. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645566</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>96</verse_id><verse_number>89</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:89) And now that there has come to them a Book from Allah, how are they &#13;
	treating it? Even though it confirms the Truth already in their possession, &#13;
	and even though they had prayed for victory against the unbelievers, and yet &#13;
	when that Book came to them – and they recognized it – they refused to acknowledge &#13;
	its Truth.&lt;sup foot_note=11246&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Allah’s curse be upon the unbelievers. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645567</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>97</verse_id><verse_number>90</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:90) Evil indeed is what they console themselves with.&lt;sup foot_note=11247&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; They &#13;
	deny the guidance revealed by Allah, grudging that He chose to bestow His gracious &#13;
	bounty (of revelation and prophethood) on some of His servants whom He willed.&lt;sup foot_note=11248&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; &#13;
	Thus they have brought on themselves wrath after wrath, and a humiliating chastisement &#13;
	is in store for such unbelievers. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645568</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>98</verse_id><verse_number>91</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:91) When they are told: “Believe in what Allah has revealed,” they say: &#13;
	“We believe only in what was revealed to us (Israel).” They deny everything &#13;
	else even though it be the Truth which confirms what they possess. Say (to them): &#13;
	“If indeed you are believers, why is it that in the past you killed the Prophets &#13;
	of Allah (who were from Israel)?” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645569</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>99</verse_id><verse_number>92</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:92) Moses came to you with clear proofs and yet you were so wont to wrong-doing &#13;
	that as soon as he was gone you took to worshipping the calf. &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645570</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>100</verse_id><verse_number>93</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:93) Recall the covenant We made with you and caused the Mount to tower &#13;
	above you, stressing: “Hold to what We have given you with full strength and &#13;
	give heed to it.” But their forefathers said: “We hear, but we disobey” – for &#13;
	their hearts were overflowing with love for the calf because of their unbelief. &#13;
	Say: “If you are people of faith, then evil are the things that your faith enjoins &#13;
	upon you.” &lt;/span&gt;</text><id>645571</id></verse><verse><chapter_id>2</chapter_id><verse_id>101</verse_id><verse_number>94</verse_number><text>&lt;span&gt;(2:94) Say to them: “If indeed the Last Abode with Allah is yours, in exclusion &#13;
	of other people, then long for death&lt;sup foot_note=11249&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; if you are truthful.”&#13;

	indeed even more eager than those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity. &#13;
	Each one of them wishes to live a thousand years although the bestowal of long &#13;
